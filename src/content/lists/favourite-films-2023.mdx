<Intro>
  <p>2023 felt like the strongest year for films in quite awhile. While the writer's strike delayed quite a number of films until the latter quarter (or even to next year), we saw new films from a number of acclaimed directors including Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan and one of my favourites, Yorgos Lanthimos.</p>

  <p>Here are some of my picks that were released in 2023…</p>
